 First step: run only main.exe and see the log file, do not run main1.exe.
 Delete log file.
 Second step: run main.exe and main1.exe both and again see the log.
 I have such log file:

 That is the first mesages loosed now.
 It seems to be that logger file is opened and resetted.
 Also note empty space where previous messages were.
 Note that log file sizes on first and second steps are equal.
