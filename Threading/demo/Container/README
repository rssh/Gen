 This demos illustrate usage of threadsafe container adapters.

Container1.cpp - simulation of Brown movement
Container2.cpp - stohastick population
Container3.cpp - same as container 2, but with multiset.

 Note, that Conatiner2 and Container3 shows the quality of rand()
algorithm under WIndows NT :(
